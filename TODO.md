- [x] load file content to editor after clicking file in file tree
- [x] auto save to the actual file on the filesystem after debounce
- [x] i dont think saves should be debounced or aborted globally. maybe per file. for simplicity's sake, maybe remove that part for now
- [x] stop trying to update after a replace
- [x] clicking a file should "route" to it
- [x] refreshing on a route should open the right file
- [ ] if you refresh on a file that is nested or not, it should be focused on the sidebar
